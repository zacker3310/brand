# brand

This is the central GitHub repository for all my **personal and professional brand assets**.

It supports both of my sites:

- [acker.cloud](https://acker.cloud) – Personal site & resume
- [thrivecmd.com](https://thrivecmd.com) – Content, culture, and side projects

---

## What's in this repo?

- ✅ Assets used in Notion/Super.so
- ✅ Custom CSS for both sites
- ✅ Social preview images
- ✅ Logos, backgrounds, and visual elements (coming soon)
- ✅ Brand style references (fonts, colors, layout notes)

---

## Usage

All files here are used across live projects and may be updated over time.  
If you're working with me or referencing my brand, this is the canonical source (work in progress).
